# NutriateMe

The aim of the application is to reduce the effects of malnutrition problems. 

The application analyzes the user's self-designed meals, suggesting potential warnings and edits to maximize dietary benefits and help
avoid future diseases and recommending a healthy mix of nutrients per meal, which is consistent with the medical data the user entered 
in the application.

In addition, an exercise section was recently added to the application, so that it could help users know the right way to practice
specific exercises, like arm, chest, and leg workouts. 

The application is, unfortunately, not AI-based, but that's what I am currently working on with my team to develop this app in the next
couple of months using Machine Learning and Big Data.

How to use it:
1. Press Sign Up
2. Enter your personal information (username, email, phonenumber,..etc.)
3. Login using your credentials
4. Enter your medical information (weight, height, !/vegeterian,... etc.)
5. Select your meals timings
6. You may either design your meal and enter the amount of each component in your dish (the application will
tell you whether this amount is enough or not) or take an instant meal
7. Go to the Exercises section and choose the kind of workouts you would like to practice
8. Exit or log out from the app
